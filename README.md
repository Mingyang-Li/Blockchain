# Blockchain
Building a Blockchain out of my curiosity with Blockchain technologies using Python

Project courtesy to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FwBB6vhilU

What I learnt:
  1. Using a library called "hashlib" to hash strings
  2. Select hash functions to use from hashlib
  3. The structure of blockchain is based on the previous transaction, which means any single change in the previous transaction will result in a different hash, this makes transactions in blockchain immutable.
  4. Encode the string and convert it to hexadecimal after hashing.
